    <p>In the not-so-distant future, humanity has evolved into a civilization driven entirely by data, energy, and control. Cities no longer sleep; they hum with the pulse of machines, their skies painted in electric blue and violet glows. The skyline is dominated by towering megastructures — each one representing a corporation.</p>

    <h2>NYTMARE</h2> 
        <p>At the center of it all stands a monolithic tower, emblazoned with a glowing digital insignia — the emblem of an entity known as Planet 9. This structure serves as the core of the city’s intelligence network, housing the Central Data Mind, an AI that manages everything from traffic to weather manipulation.</p>
